Write notebook that opens a text file, tokenizes it and identifies the top 10 high-frequency words. To do this you need to:

    Put the text file in the folder with the notebook.
    Figure out the code for opening a text file and reading it into a variable. Can you figure out how to find code that will open a file and read it in?
    Then you want to split it into words (tokenize it).
    Then you need to count the words and find the top ten.

The important thing is to explain what you are doing using markdown cells.
